About <sorry> of Justin Bieber
<Sorry> is a song about a relationship with a girl, but I'd instead think it as an apologetic to the public.
Before Justin Bieber, the only American singer that I know of is lady gaga and Machel Jackson.
He is so famous that you can hear girls talk about him all the time. 
However, in 2012, all of a sudden, he started drinking, smoking drugs, which totally against the image that he has set up in public.
Not until 2015, he launched <sorry> along with <what do you mean>. These two sons gained him the love from fans as well as the critics.
As a person who does not relate to the pop culture, I have not heard of this song until 2017, and it suddenly attracts me.
The use of instrument and electronic are fantastic, and I know that Justin has grown from a pop singer to an independent artist.
Four years ago, I was in the middle of the revolutionary period, and did something horrible to my parents, continually lying, trying to hang out with friends on the street, etc.
But my parents handled it pretty well, never beat me up, always trying to talk, so after about three months, my rebellious period peacefully is gone.
So <sorry> is the exact song I am looking for to express myself, "Cause I need one more shot at forgiveness."
