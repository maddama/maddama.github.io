Black Males
It's quie a long time since african american bagan to fight for their rights, but after seeing the exhibition of " black males", I believe that there are some problems still need more time to be solved.
##About "you can't be smart"
First, the antiintellectual culture that exist in black male community, some of their friends may think black males are born to be less smart which was mislead by the white Supremacy. So the whole community would think being smart is a humiliating thing. 
I think it is a very common situation bot only exist in the black male society, I myself sometimes feel the same way. It all started in my first year in high school, that I failed a math exam and the teacher called me stupid and should work twice hard than my peer to get a good grade in math. Ever since then, I always think that I am weak at math, but instead of working on it, I choose to avoid it, I started to work harder on my english and physics to compensate for my "weakness" in math. 
However, as a engineer student, there is no way that you can get away with advance math if you want to pursue a master degree or more, so last semester I devoted 75% of my time to study math, and it ended well, I get a grade beyond average, which is astonishing to me since I have been believe this affirmation for about 5 years and it has done quite a damage to my study.
##About code of street
And there are code of street, the kind of language that contain a lot of words like "dope" & "sup" in it, and the talks are always about girls and cops etc. 
Speaking the same language can generate a strong sense of belonging, which can make it harder for black males to get rid of the influence of their original community. This is so sad that normally communication is the way people get educated and becoming aware of being a part of the society, which would finally led to responsibility.But in this case, communicate with others in "code of street" would only lead to rebellious.
