It's quite a long time since African American began to fight for their rights. But after seeing the exhibition of " black males," I believe that there are some problems still need more time to be solved.
##About "you can't be smart."
First, the antiintellectual culture that exists in the black male community, some of their friends may think black males are born to be less smart. I believe the white Supremacy misled this. So the whole community would think being smart is a humiliating thing.

I think it is a very common situation bot only exist in the black male society. I sometimes feel the same way. It all started in my first year in high school that I failed a math exam, and the teacher called me stupid and should work twice hard than my peer to get a good grade in math. 

Ever since then, I always think that I am weak at math, but instead of working on it, I choose to avoid it, I started to work harder on my English and physics to compensate for my "weakness" in math. 

However, as an engineering student, there is no way that you can get away with advance math if you want to pursue a master degree or more. So last semester I devoted 75% of my time to study math, and it ended well, 
I get a grade beyond average, which is astonishing to me since I have believed this affirmation for about five years and it has done quite a damage to my study.
##About code of the street
And there is code of the street, the kind of language that contains a lot of words like "dope" & "sup" in it, and the talks are always about girls and cops, etc. 

Speaking the same language can generate a strong sense of belonging, which can make it harder for black males to get rid of the influence of their original community. 

This phenomenon is so sad that usually, communication is the way people get educated and becoming aware of being a part of society, which would finally lead to responsibility. But in this case, communicate with others in "code of the street" would only lead to rebellious.
