For this week's field work, I chose to go to San Fransisco and visited two wonderful museums there. 

But actually I went to these two museums last weekend, since I have to go to yosimite this weekend, so I think I should write this done as my blog post this week.

##Some events of July 28th
Last weekend, July 28th, I think it is a big day to Sanfransisco, three people dead in a shooting at Gilroy Garlic Festival. It is always horrible to hear somebody died during a mass shotting, I think the White House should do more with legislation to prevent this from happening.

Also, there is Berkeley Kite Festival. It is such a pity that we couldn't been there as we have already planned our day before I got this messege.

However, on our way to exploratorium, we are lucky to see the San Fransisco marathon. It was 9:00 am, the participants are busy warmig up.

##Having fun in exploreiom
exploratorium is a very interesting place to go to. It has so many scientific stuff you can play with, and a lot of cute children runing around you while you are having fun with the gagets.
