For this week's field work, I chose to go to San Fransisco and with two of my frined, Shang Yangxing and Dr.Zhu Lin, we visited two wonderful museums there. 

Actually I went to these two museums last weekend, since I have to go to yosimite this weekend, so I think I should write this done as my blog post this week.

##Some events of July 28th
Last weekend, July 28th, I think it is a big day to Sanfransisco, three people dead in a shooting at Gilroy Garlic Festival and 12 people are wounded. It is always horrible to hear somebody died during a mass shotting, I think the White House should do more with legislation to prevent this from happening.

Also, there is Berkeley Kite Festival in July 28th. It is such a pity that we couldn't been there as we have already planned our day before I got this messege.

However, on our way to exploratorium, we are lucky to see the San Fransisco marathon. It was 9:00 am, the participants are busy warmig up. Compare to Wuhan marothon, the SF marathon have more candidates and people are having fun there istead of trying to live longer through exercise while working overloaded(*￣∇￣*).

##Having fun in exploreiom
exploratorium is a very interesting place to go to. It has so many scientific stuff you can play with, and a lot of cute children runing around you while you are having fun with the gagets. The science behind the collections are very simple, but it is fun to experience the effect of it in person.

As a engineer student who is chasing a career as a teacher in college, I am inspired a lot by this show, maybe I would make a installation like this of my own after returing to China.
Sometimes I think I have worried too much about my future, and focus on getting high grades and start saving money for house loan. And I ignored the beauty of science in the process, this museum remid me what my intension to learn technology is. I think I should keep telling myself that I am not study for stress but study to be knowledgable and live a good life.

##A tour at MOMA  
It is such a loss that I missed the open day at MOMA and didn't noticed that it is posted on the SELS website(sad face). But MOMA definitely worth my 19 dollers. There are many exhibitions going on there. 

I found a set of phtotgraphy about  the life of a Chinese woman named Chang and her lover Lacy life in San Fransisco. They are shouted 1977. Originally, I think it to be somethinf about raely lesbian love, but it turned out to be a art work reflects early Chinese immigrants' life.

The early Chinese immigrants face a lot of threats including forced prostution, salavry and health problem, the foregin missionary seem to be their only hope to get education and health.

It drive to look back to the history of China in the 70s, there are intense political movement that time, but I don't think the woman would face forced prostution or even salavry, since these behavior couldn't exist that time. People could be convict guilty by some baseless evidence and get killed or tortued because of it, but it is impossible for people to be forced salavry at that times.

In the second floor, there are also a exhibition hold by a ma

It is quite interesting to know how  modern artist think of the world, some may think that the world is nothing more than some shape and color.

Some may think it is nothing different than the ancient world. Something have never changed.

Some create beauty with their camera.

Some build grace with their painting brush.
