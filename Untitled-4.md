For this week's fieldwork, I chose to go to San Fransisco with two of my friends, Shang Yangxing and Dr.Zhu Lin. We visited two beautiful museums there. 

I went to these two museums last weekend since I have to go to Yosemite this weekend, so I think I should write this done as my blog post this week.

##Some events of July 28th
Last Sunday, July 28th, I think it is a big day to San Fransisco. Three people died in a shooting at Gilroy Garlic Festival, and 12 people are wounded. It is always horrible to hear somebody killed during a mass shooting. I think the White House should do more with legislation to prevent this from happening.

Also, there is the Berkeley Kite Festival on July 28th. It is such a pity that we couldn't be there as we had already planned our day before I got this message.

However, on our way to exploratorium, we are lucky to see the San Fransisco Marathon. It was 9:00 am, the participants are busy warming up. Compare to the Wuhan marathon, the SF marathon has more candidates, and people are having fun there instead of trying to live longer through exercise while working overloaded(*￣∇￣*).

##Having fun in the exploratorium
Exploratorium is a fascinating place to visit. It has so many scientific stuff you can play with, and a lot of cute children running around you while you are having fun with the gadgets. The science behind the collections is elementary, but it is fun to experience the effect of it in person.

As an engineering student chasing a career as a researcher, I am inspired a lot by this show. Maybe I would make an installation like this of my own after returning to China.
Sometimes I think I have worried too much about my future, and focus on getting high grades and start saving money for the mortgage. And I ignored the beauty of science in the process. This museum reminds me of what my intension to learn technology is. I should keep telling myself that I am not studying for stress but consider to be knowledgable and live a good life.

##A tour at MOMA 
It is such a loss that I missed the open day at MOMA and didn't notice the notice on the SELS website(sad face). But MOMA worth my 19 dollars. Many exhibitions are going on there. 

I found a set of photography about the life of a Chinese woman named Chang and an American woman named Lacy's life in San Fransisco. The photographer shot them in 1977. Initially, I think it to be something about rarely lesbian love, but it turned out to be an artwork reflects early Chinese immigrants' life.

The early Chinese immigrants face a lot of threats, including forced prostitution, slavery, and health problem.
At that time, the foreign missionary seems to be their only hope to get education and health.

It drives me to look back to the history of China in the 70s.
Yes, there is an intense political movement at that time, but I don't think the woman would face forced prostitution or even slavery. People could be convicted guilty by some baseless evidence and get killed or tortured because of it, but people can't be compelled slavery at those times.

On the second floor, there is also an exhibition for April Dawn Alison's work. She/He has lived as a man for about 60 years in the world. But after her/his death, people found a lot of self-portrait in her/his house that shows her/his strong female persona. Some of the articles are interesting that she/he shows part of his body in the picture that my friend thinks she/he is just a sexy lady with a man's face. It shows that our gender expression is more important than our original gender.

It is quite interesting to know how the modern artist thinks of the world. Some may think that the world is nothing more than some shape and color.

Some may think it is nothing different than the ancient world. Something has never changed.

Some create beauty with their camera.

Some build grace with their painting brush.

If I could get another chance to visit the MOMA, I definitely would.
