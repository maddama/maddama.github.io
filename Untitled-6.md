I had a fairly good trip to yosimite, and learned a lot of the history of Callifornia on the way to tosimite.

We all know that the flag of California has a giant bear on it, it is a grizzly bear, which have all been killed for potential human injury. The current bear alive in California all are black bears, and I am luck enough to spot one on the yosemite park! It is such a pity that our bus are prohubited to stop at the spot so I only get a blury shot of the eating bear.

On our long way across the California valley, the endless pasture and fields of corn are enjoyable. The tour guide told us that California have provided a quater of American agricultural finance, but the animal husbandry have caused serious pollution to the land of the valley. And due to the economic growth of the valley, more and more people moved in, which caused more damage to the land.

But I am so astonnished by the advance of the argricultural techniques, and almost want to settle down here to be a famer, getting away from the city and provide me and my family with my bare hands and all the machines. But after all, it is just a fantasy, there is no way I could make such a huge turn in my life.

Then she also filled us with the history of California. California was originally the domain of the Spainsh, who have spent over a hundred years in California looking for gold. The Spainish find nothing and finally the land was taken by rebellian, who found the California republic, which finally merge into the U.S.. That's why the California state flag has a republic on it.

There are many redwood in Berkeley, they are young giant sequoias. Since they are so young, they don't quite look like a giant sequoias. Adult sequoias has no branches on the bottom of it, but young sequoias would keep it. In yosimite national park, I saw what is said to be one of the largest tree in the world, it is called the grizzly giant. And I have heard a very interesting story about it, it goes like this: a young man found the tree and called on his friends to come and paya visit to it as well. However, his friends are not interested in it, so he made up of a story that he have killed a grizzly bear on the mountain, so his friens all went with him. Since then, the tree became famous and people named it with the story.

We also spotted a lot of fallen tree due to the wild fire. Because of the constant drought, wild fire became more frequent, and more tree have been flamed because of it, the grasses on the pasture are also drier than usual. I also learned a interesting story about why fire burn faster uphill. This is because the flames can easily reach more unburnt fuel in front of the fire. Radiant heat pre-heats the fuel in front of the fire, making the fuel even more flammable.

And conservation like yosemite are properties of the federal government, so we can't take out a single stone out of it and should leave nothing but our footprint. And president Trump is now trying to cut down the area of national park so that there could be more industry and the economic will rise accordingly. This could be a huge damage to the conserved area, and it is only a short-term solution to the problem that American encountered right now. I think one of the reason that makes developed country a developed country is that it doesn't need to destroy the environment and labour its people to maintain the growth of the economics. In China, we have a saying foe that behavior:" Kill the chick for one egg", which you will never get more eggs after you killed it.

And a very bad phenomenon happens during our trip. Everytime we get together to get on the bus, people get late, and they are all Chinese students. I feel so humiliated at thosetimes. Though I know that I am not the one to blame, but you always want your country with
