I had a fairly good trip to yosimite, and learned a lot of the history of Callifornia on the way to tosimite.

We all know that the flag of California has a giant bear on it, it is a grizzly bear, which have all been killed for potential human injury. The current bear alive in California all are black bears, and I am luck enough to spot one on the yosimite park! It is such a pity that our bus are prohubited to stop at the spot so I only get a blury shot of the eating bear.

On our long way across the California valley, the endless pasture and fields of corn are enjoyable. The tour guide told us that California have provided a quater of American agricultural finance, but the animal husbandry have caused serious pollution to the land of the valley. And due to the economic growth of the valley, more and more people moved in, which caused more damage to the land.

But I am so astonnished by the advance of the argricultural techniques, and almost want to settle down here to be a famer, getting away from the city and provide me and my family with my bare hands and all the machines. But after all, it is just a fantasy, there is no way I could make such a huge turn in my life.

Then she also filled us with the history of California. California was originally the domain of the Spainsh, who have spent over a hundred years in California looking for gold. The Spainish find nothing and finally the land was taken by rebellian, who found the California republic, which finally merge into the U.S.. That's why the California state flag has a republic on it.

There are many redwood in Berkeley, they are young giant sequoias. Since they are so young, they don't quite look like a giant sequoias. Adult sequoias has no branches on the bottom of it, but young sequoias would keep it. In yosimite national park, I saw what is said to be one of the largest tree in the world, it is called the grizzly giant. And I have heard a very interesting story about it, it goes like this: a young man found the tree and called on his friends to come and paya visit to it as well. However, his friends are not interested in it, so he made up of a story that he have killed a grizzly bear on the mountain, so his friens all went with him. Since then, the tree became famous
