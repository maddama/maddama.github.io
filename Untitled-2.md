A Tour To Museum Of The African Diaspora
Since the information that we get at the oakland museum of california is so little that I can hardly get to know about the topic we are talking about this week, I headed to MOAD(Museum Of The African Diaspora) this weekend to learn more about the topic.
This is a museum known for its activities, which I am not lucky enough to catch one.
##Coffee, Rhum, Sugar & Gold
###the influence of colonazation
It is a interesting topic about how the colonist have change our lifestyle and our workstyle. The exhibition contain a lot of staff that focus on this topic.
There are people with their head painted black wear suits and sexy stockings, which used to be clothing that white people wear.
This situation happened to China as well, with the development of office culture, more and more Chinese company began to ask their employees to wear a suit to work. It always considered a behavior of modernlization. After seeing that exhibition, I realize that this kind of behavior is nothing more than a new form of colonazation.
##Everybody Loves the Sunshine
###Beauty politics
This is exhibition full of collections made of human hairs. Long hairs are often considered a significant symbolization of african american and mexican american, and palys a important role in racial identity.
The artist express her sense of beauty through her artwork by twisting the hair into the traditional african style.
Beauty politics is a new topic to me, so I did a little research about it, and I found some interesting conclusions. "How we should look like?" and "What is beauty?" can largely decide our self-identity, and finally became a political issue.
