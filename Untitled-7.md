I have been to trader joe’s and Safeway several times. Most times, I would go there and try to find some cereal and dairy for my breakfast. Sometimes I also try to get some vegetables and meat for lunch. However, since I have purchased a very expensive meal plan in Berkeley, so it is not wise to cook my own meals, thus I can save time and money. 
Actually, I have tried to make a sandwich for Ms.Mason’s birthday, but the meat doesn't taste well, and the bread is very tough, barely unchewable, so I quit the idea. By now, the tomato and lettuce are still lying in my refrigerator.
I have noticed a phenomenon that when it comes to the product can be massively produced, the product tends to be much cheaper than those can’t be automatically produced. I guess it has something to do with the high labour costs in American.
About the placement of the store, the shelf of snacks and jams are in the centre of the store and surrounded by refrigerators and shelf of fruit and vegetables, sometimes they also put some bagged vegetables in the refrigerator, which are produced by trader joe’s itself. I think it can maximize the possibility of people buying their own stuff. Also, by decorating the store this way, people who are only interested in buying snacks will be separated from people intended buying unprocessed product.
I always find the pepper in American not spicy enough compared to those sold in China, and I only learned to cook with garlic, soybean sauce and pepper. So it is very difficult for me to find a proper recipe to cook this week. I think I may just put some of the vegetabless together, put them into the boiled water, then I can put some of the apple sayce I get at the trader joes on top of it to make a simple salad.
For more information to complete the whole lot of questions for us in this fieldwork, I went to trader joe's with Xu Liao and Rebeca this Thursday after shot the first scene of our film.We find someone at the produce department and ask her the questions given by Ms. Mason, but she said that she is only a new worker here, we should ask the manager.
So we asked the manager where the pepper and greenbean were produced, and he told us that the pepper are from Mexico or somewhere else since the label on it says that it is produced outside of American, and the greenbeans are local, produced and bagged at California. The trader joe's company participated in the whole process from the plantation to the delivery of the greenbean.
I have bought two types of cheap meat, which apparently not organic, and they both taste awful. One have been mixed into too much powder that it should be called ham instead of becon or meat. The other is too salty and have a strong taste of the blood which I can't get away with it with boiling water, I tried mix it with scranboued egg, but it didn't turn well, either. They both lying at the bottom of my refrigirator quietly right now.
Next day, I went to the famer's market in downtown berkeley with my roomate, and lucky enough to catch a dacing festival here, I asked my roomate to have a little dance with me, but he refused immediately. We are both single nerdy rngineering studends, but I think this trip to American and the English course have changed me a lot, I am more open to new things and willing to explore. But my roommate only attend two easy lecture, so he have plenty of time playing video games at his bedrrom, I think his behavior is  kind of irresponsble for his future and his parents' hard work to get him here.
There are about 30 tents that sells differant product at the market, I think I can divide it into four sections. 
The first I think should be the meal section, which is clostest to the busy street at east. There are African food and Indian food and ice cream and so on, I think it is a little expensive than the ones in trader joe's. A normal ice cream in small cup could cost me 4 bucks, which trader joe's sells at the price of 3 bucks.
The second section I think should be the fruit section where people sells peaches, oranges and melons and so on. I bought 3 peaches there and it costs me 5.65 bucks, and the price is also a little more expensive than the ones in trader, where I can buy 5 or more peaches with the same price. The farmer sold peaches told me that they have 5 types of peaches today, and they have planted much more types of peaches in thier hacienda. She told me that they live in broadwest( which I could not find on the google map, I think I had misheared what she said), it is not far from berkeley.
The third is the vegetable section, I did not do much research here.
The fourth is the general famer's product section, where jams and chocolete are sold. I have bought a black chocolete for our class, because I tasted it, and it turned out to be pretty well. The chocolete are produced right at a factory at the west coast in berkeley, and the ingredients are from south oakland.
I think famers who work with their family can't compete with the big company at price since they have controled thousands of farmers. The big company can let people work in the assembly line to raise efficiency which farmer work as indivisuals can never achive. 
So, my conclusion is, big company have the advantage in proce so farmers work indivisually can never compete with them. So vegetable and meat in package will be sold in more prevanlence, and it will be more diffibult for poor people to get organic food.
