I have been to trader joe’s and Safeway several times. Most times, I would go there and try to find some cereal and dairy for my breakfast. Sometimes I also try to get some vegetables and meat for lunch. However, since I have purchased a very expensive meal plan in Berkeley, so it is not wise to cook my own meals, thus I can save time and money. 
Actually, I have tried to make a sandwich for Ms.Mason’s birthday, but the meat doesn't taste well, and the bread is very tough, barely unchewable, so I quit the idea. By now, the tomato and lettuce are still lying in my refrigerator.
I have noticed a phenomenon that when it comes to the product can be massively produced, the product tends to be much cheaper than those can’t be automatically produced. I guess it has something to do with the high labour costs in American.
About the placement of the store, the shelf of snacks and jams are in the centre of the store and surrounded by refrigerators and shelf of fruit and vegetables, sometimes they also put some bagged vegetables in the refrigerator, which are produced by trader joe’s itself. I think it can maximize the possibility of people buying their own stuff. Also, by decorating the store this way, people who are only interested in buying snacks will be separated from people intended buying unprocessed product.
I always find the pepper in American not spicy enough compared to those sold in China, and I only learned to cook with garlic, soybean sauce and pepper. So it is very difficult for me to find a proper recipe to cook this week. I think I may just put some of the vegetabless together, put them into the boiled water, then I can put some of the apple sayce I get at the trader joes on top of it to make a simple salad.
For more information to complete the whole lot of questions for us in this fieldwork, I went to trader joe's with Xu Liao and Rebeca this Thursday after shot the first scene of our film.We find someone at the produce department and ask her the questions given by Ms. Mason, but she said that she is only a new worker here, we should ask the manager.
So we asked the manager where the pepper and greenbean were produced, and he told us that the pepper are from Mexico or somewhere else since the label on it says that it is produced outside of American, and the greenbeans are local, produced and bagged at California. The trader joe's company participated in the whole process from the plantation to the delivery of the greenbean.
I have bought two types of cheap meat, which apparently not organic, and they both taste awful. One have been mixed into too much powder that it should be called ham instead of becon or meat. The other is too salty and have a strong taste of the blood which I can't get away with it with boiling water, I tried mix it with scranboued egg, but it didn't turn well, either. They both lying at the bottom of my refrigirator quietly right now.
Next day, I went to the famer's market in downtown berkeley with my roomate, and lucky enough to catch a dacing festival here, I asked my roomate to have a little dance with me, but he refused immediately
