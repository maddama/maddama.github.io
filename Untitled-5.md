Hip Hop and Political Change.
I went to the speech at dwinelle hall, it is quite fascinating and thought-provoking. And it discuss many issues that Ms.Mason had raised in our class.

##How does stereotype forms?
Davey D made a very good explainment about how the sterotype forms. People all over the country are getting second hand information from the media, and few people can get the first-hand material. When he ask about how many students on the scene have ever eatten lunch with their black classmates, among the almost 200 students, nobody raised his hands.

Because of this stuation, the media became the only source people get to know groups other than theor race. However, the media is also a company, it only focus on its own business interest, and no one in the area would stand out to say something for the black. And Hip-Hop started to be related to drugs and girls, while it originally meant for love and peace.

##How can musicians change the politics?
Davey D talked about three ways that hip hop musicians can affect the politics.

He listed a long list of famous hip hop musicians and how many instagram followers do they own, I think the list go as 50 Cent, Killer Mike, J.A.V, KANYE WEST and  espeacially Cardi Bi, who have over 48 million followers on tweet. In this way, the artist gain =ed the equivalent position as a presidential candidate. 

Besides, they also affect the political world through apublishing songs that attack politicians directly. Like<Fuck D.Trump>, <Bush Killer> and a song write for president Cliton <Sleeping with the enemy>. 

Also, they can get political power by donate to politicians and affect the politics.

In this way, I think the internet really changed the political world. The #metoo movement fight for women's rights and hip hop musicians fight for black community's rights.
