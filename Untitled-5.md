Hip Hop and Political Change.
I went to the speech at Dwinelle hall. It is quite fascinating and thought-provoking. And it discussed many issues that Ms.Mason had raised in our class.

##How does stereotype forms?
Davey D made a remarkable statement about how the stereotype forms. People all over the country are getting second-hand information from the media, and few people can get the first-hand material. When he asked about how many students on the scene have ever eaten lunch with their black classmates, among the almost 200 students, nobody raised his hands.

Because of this situation, the media became the only source people get to know groups other than their race. However, the media is also a company, it only focuses on its business interest, and no one in the area would stand out to say something for the black. And Hip-Hop started to be related to drugs and girls, while it originally meant for love and peace. As Davey D said, people get lazy when it comes to knowing someone from a different group.

##How can musicians change politics?
Davey D talked about three ways that hip hop musicians can affect politics.

He listed a long list of famous hip hop musicians and how many Instagram followers do their own. As far as I can remeber, the list goes as 50 Cent, Killer Mike, J.A.V, KANYE WEST and especially Cardi Bi, who have over 48 million followers on Tweet. In this way, the artist gain =ed the equivalent position as a presidential candidate. 

Besides, they also affect the political world through publishing songs that attack politicians directly. Like<Fuck D.Trump>, <Bush Killer> and a song writes for president Clinton <Sleeping with the enemy>. 

Also, they can get political power by donating to politicians and affect politics.

In this way, I think the internet changed the political world. The #metoo movement fight for women's rights and hip hop musicians fight for the black community's rights.

##How to get live in white society as a black male?
K.J have mentioned a lot of occasions that he gets mistreated as a black artist. 
Every time he is about to give a lecture, the audience would say "Are you here to give a speech about racism?"

And he always receives people's strange face when he holds his little girl. Because the public often gets the message from the media that the black father is irresponsible.

##How to use Hip Hop as a tool to educate?
K.J has worked for a reputable international organization named green peace. I think this is remarkable since K.J was born in a notorious neighbourhood, yet he gets in the California State University. I don't think I can get this far if given such a situation.

And he is one of the founder of the organization Hip Hop For Change, where he teaches children how to hip hop and make peace with the world with a fair price or free. People doubt him, doubt whether hip hop should be a teaching tool, but he and his team work it out and have taught for over 2000 kids in the bay area.

Respect, Davey D and K.J
